Four heavy-duty casters swivel a full 360 degrees and lock in place with brakes, so an office or classroom can wheel it between rooms and dock it firmly once positioned.

Locking casters hold the cart steady once positioned, and the design suits home, office, or retail settings equally well.

  {
    criterion: "How many casters actually lock",
    explanation:
      "Every cart in this list advertises \"rolling wheels,\" but the number that lock and whether they include a true brake versus a simple swivel-stop varies. Check the specific listing for how many of the four casters include a locking brake if the cart will sit in a busy hallway or classroom.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weight capacity vs your actual display",
    explanation:
      "Most mobile TV stands in this category cap out around 88 to 99 pounds, enough for most flat-panel TVs up to 65 inches but not for larger commercial displays. Confirm your TV's actual weight, not just its screen size, before assuming a mobile cart can support it.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Tilt range for glare control",
    explanation:
      "Overhead fluorescent lighting in offices and classrooms creates glare that a fixed vertical mount can't compensate for. A cart with 5 to 15 degrees of downward tilt, like the PERLESMITH PSTVMC06, lets you angle the screen away from ceiling lights without repositioning the whole cart.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Base footprint and tip-over resistance",
    explanation:
      "A wide, X-shaped or heavy-gauge base resists tipping far better than a narrow four-post frame, especially when the cart rolls over a door threshold or gets bumped in a crowded hallway. Look for a documented anti-tip base if the cart will be used in a school, hotel, or other high-traffic setting.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "VESA compatibility",
    explanation:
      "Confirm your TV's VESA hole pattern matches the cart's supported range before ordering. Most general-purpose mobile stands here top out around 400x400mm, which covers the vast majority of TVs up to 65 inches, but smaller carts like the Rfiver Power Outlet pick only support up to 200x200mm.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Built-in power and AV shelving",
    explanation:
      "A cart that moves between rooms often needs to power a laptop, streaming box, or camera at its destination without relying on a nearby outlet. Built-in AC outlets or a height-adjustable AV shelf add real convenience for office and AV use cases, though they typically add cost.",

    q: "What is the best mobile TV stand overall?",
    a: "The BONTEC Rolling TV Stand with Tilt (Pick 1) has the largest review base in this list at over 16,000 ratings, all four casters lock, and it includes a 10 degree tilt for glare control, making it the strongest general-purpose pick for offices and classrooms.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is a mobile TV stand different from a TV stand on wheels for a living room?",
    a: "Mobile TV stands in this list are built around VESA mount plates for rolling between rooms in offices, schools, or AV setups, prioritizing locking casters, tilt range, and a compact wheeled base. A living-room stand on wheels, like the picks in our TV Stands on Wheels guide, typically adds open or enclosed media shelving since it's expected to sit in one spot most of the time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which mobile TV stand has the highest weight capacity?",
    a: "The PERLESMITH PSTVMC04 (Pick 3) has the highest weight capacity in this list at 99 lbs. Most other general-purpose picks here cap out around 88 lbs, while the smaller Rfiver Power Outlet pick (Pick 6) is rated for 55 lbs on smaller displays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do any mobile TV stands include built-in power outlets?",
    a: "Yes, the Rfiver Rolling TV Stand with Power Outlet (Pick 6) is the only pick in this list with built-in AC outlets and a safety switch, though it's sized for smaller TVs from 13 to 50 inches.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are mobile TV stands stable enough for schools and high-traffic areas?",
    a: "Several picks in this list are specifically built for this use case. The BONTEC TC-003B (Pick 4) includes an anti-tip base for crowded environments, and the Rfiver MT2004 (Pick 5) uses a wide X-shape base for extra tip-over resistance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What TV size range do mobile TV stands typically support?",
    a: "Most general-purpose mobile TV stands in this list support 23 to 65 inch TVs, which covers the vast majority of office, classroom, and conference room displays. The Rfiver Power Outlet pick (Pick 6) is the exception, built for smaller 13 to 50 inch displays.",
