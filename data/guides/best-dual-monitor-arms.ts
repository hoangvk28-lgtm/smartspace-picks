An arm rated for 22 lbs per side can still sag on the heavier of two mismatched panels if the pole and joint tension were tuned for even loads, and that gap between spec sheet and real-world balance is where most dual arm complaints come from.",

    q: "Can a dual monitor arm handle two different-size monitors?",
    a: "Most can, within their stated per-arm weight limit, but counterbalance can be uneven if one monitor is noticeably heavier than the other. Check the per-arm rating against your heavier monitor's actual panel weight (not the boxed weight with the stand), and consider a higher-capacity pick like the HUANUO Dual Monitor Mount (Advanced System) at 22 lbs per arm if the gap is significant.",
  },
  {
    q: "How tall does the pole need to be for eye-level monitors?",
    a: "It depends on your desk height and your own height. A standard 40-50cm pole works fine for most users under 175cm on a standard 28-30\" desk, but a taller user around 180cm or more may find a standard pole too short to reach eye level. Check the specific pole height spec before buying if you're on the taller side.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I mount two ultrawide monitors on a dual arm?",
    a: "No, not on any standard dual bracket in this list. A 34\" or larger ultrawide at 7kg or more exceeds what most dual arm brackets can safely support. Use a heavy-duty single arm like the HUANUO TitanLift Heavy Duty Monitor Arm for each ultrawide instead.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I choose side-by-side or vertical stacking?",
    a: "Side-by-side works best on a wide desk with no ceiling constraints, while vertical stacking, like the Ergotron LX Vertical Stacking Dual Monitor Arm, saves horizontal desk space on a narrow desk but needs real ceiling clearance since a stacked pair sits noticeably taller.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much desk clearance does a dual arm clamp need?",
    a: "Plan for at least 15-20cm of clear, flat desk-underside space for the clamp to bite properly, more than a single arm needs. Small desks or L-shaped desk corners often don't have that much clear space, so measure before ordering, especially if you're mounting in a corner.",
