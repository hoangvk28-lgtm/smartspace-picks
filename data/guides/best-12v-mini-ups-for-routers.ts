export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match voltage before capacity",
    "explanation": "Check your router's power adapter label for its exact output voltage (usually 5V, 9V, or 12V) and current draw in amps before comparing battery capacity. A mini UPS with the wrong voltage can damage the router even if the plug physically fits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Convert mAh to Wh to compare fairly",
    "explanation": "A 20,000mAh unit built around a 3.7V cell and a 10,400mAh unit built around a higher-voltage pack can carry similar real energy. Look for a watt-hour (Wh) figure in the listing, or multiply mAh by pack voltage and divide by 1000, before ranking products by capacity alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm connector size and polarity",
    "explanation": "Most of these units use a 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC barrel connector, but not all do, and center-pin polarity (positive vs negative tip) varies by brand even at the same voltage. A mismatched polarity can damage the router on first use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the combined wattage ceiling, not just per-port ratings",
    "explanation": "Multi-output units rarely guarantee every port can deliver its maximum rating simultaneously. If you're powering a router and a modem or camera off the same UPS, add up both devices' wattage and compare it against the unit's stated total output ceiling, not the sum of each port's individual maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Don't trust advertised runtime hours at face value",
    "explanation": "Manufacturer runtime claims ('up to 5 hours') are usually measured against a specific, often low, wattage load. A router pulling 10-15W will drain a battery meaningfully faster than the manufacturer's test load. Treat published hours as a best case, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE is not the same as active PoE",
    "explanation": "A handful of these units output passive PoE (a fixed voltage sent down unused Ethernet pairs) rather than IEEE 802.3af/at active PoE with negotiation. Passive PoE only works with equipment designed for it; plugging an active-PoE device into a passive-PoE mini UPS can damage the device."
