  "\"Mini DC UPS\" is the more precise term for this whole product category, a battery backup that outputs low-voltage direct current (5V, 9V, 12V) rather than the AC output of a conventional UPS. That distinction matters because a DC UPS connects straight to a router's barrel jack with no AC-to-DC conversion happening at the router end.",
  "We used this page to focus on the DC-specific fundamentals: exact output voltage per rail, connector size and polarity, and watt-hours, since these are the details that determine electrical safety, not just runtime."

  }
];

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Match voltage before capacity",
    "explanation": "Check your router's power adapter label for its exact output voltage (usually 5V, 9V, or 12V) and current draw in amps before comparing battery capacity. A mini UPS with the wrong voltage can damage the router even if the plug physically fits."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Convert mAh to Wh to compare fairly",
    "explanation": "A 20,000mAh unit built around a 3.7V cell and a 10,400mAh unit built around a higher-voltage pack can carry similar real energy. Look for a watt-hour (Wh) figure in the listing, or multiply mAh by pack voltage and divide by 1000, before ranking products by capacity alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm connector size and polarity",
    "explanation": "Most of these units use a 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC barrel connector, but not all do, and center-pin polarity (positive vs negative tip) varies by brand even at the same voltage. A mismatched polarity can damage the router on first use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check the combined wattage ceiling, not just per-port ratings",
    "explanation": "Multi-output units rarely guarantee every port can deliver its maximum rating simultaneously. If you're powering a router and a modem or camera off the same UPS, add up both devices' wattage and compare it against the unit's stated total output ceiling, not the sum of each port's individual maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Don't trust advertised runtime hours at face value",
    "explanation": "Manufacturer runtime claims ('up to 5 hours') are usually measured against a specific, often low, wattage load. A router pulling 10-15W will drain a battery meaningfully faster than the manufacturer's test load. Treat published hours as a best case, not a guarantee."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Passive PoE is not the same as active PoE",
    "explanation": "A handful of these units output passive PoE (a fixed voltage sent down unused Ethernet pairs) rather than IEEE 802.3af/at active PoE with negotiation. Passive PoE only works with equipment designed for it; plugging an active-PoE device into a passive-PoE mini UPS can damage the device."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 'mini DC UPS' different from a regular UPS?",
    "a": "Yes. A conventional UPS outputs AC power through a standard wall outlet, with the connected device's own power adapter converting it to DC. A mini DC UPS skips that step and outputs DC directly at the router's required voltage, which is why voltage and connector matching matter so much more here than with an AC UPS."
