export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C is a connector, not a speed",
    "explanation": "A USB-C port itself guarantees nothing about Ethernet speed, anywhere for macbook air you still need to check the exact chipset-rated speed and required USB generation before assuming compatibility. Verify both figures directly in the listing rather than inferring speed from the connector type. This is the single most common point of confusion when comparing adapters across different hosts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multi-gig speeds need a fast enough USB port",
    "explanation": "Rated adapter speed and actual achieved speed for macbook air are two different things once the host's USB port generation is factored in, a slower port caps performance regardless of the adapter's own rating. Verify your host supports the required USB mode before buying for the higher speed tier. Don't assume the adapter alone determines your real throughput."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check OS and driver requirements before buying",
    "explanation": "OS and driver requirements vary meaningfully for macbook air, some adapters are plug-and-play on one platform and need a manufacturer driver or specific OS version on another. Check compatibility explicitly for your actual operating system and version, not just \"Windows/Mac compatible\" marketing language. This is especially worth verifying on less common host platforms."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm your specific device isn't excluded",
    "explanation": "A USB-C connector alone doesn't guarantee compatibility for macbook air, some adapters explicitly exclude specific devices or chip generations in their fine print. Read the full compatibility list before buying rather than trusting the general category claim. This exclusion is easy to miss if you only skim the main bullet points."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A CAT6 cable matters as much as the adapter",
    "explanation": "Even a genuinely capable adapter for macbook air will fall back to slower speeds over an inadequate cable, an old CAT5 run caps a Gigabit-capable adapter well below its rated speed. Use CAT6 or better for Gigabit, and CAT6A for multi-gig speeds, to actually realize the adapter's rated performance. The adapter is only half of the real-world speed equation."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PD passthrough wattage isn't automatically usable",
    "explanation": "The PD passthrough wattage printed on an adapter for macbook air assumes a matching charger and cable are also in the chain, without both, you won't see that rated power. Verify your actual charger and cable both support the stated wattage. The adapter's spec sheet number is a maximum, not something it generates on its own."

    "q": "Does MacBook Air support the same adapters as MacBook Pro?",
