export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  { criterion: "Hard vs soft top surface", explanation: "The single most important factor is whether the top surface is hard or soft. Soft fabric or foam top surfaces allow laptop bottom vents to be partially blocked. A hard MDF or wood surface keeps vents completely clear regardless of how the laptop sits on it. All recommended picks use hard surfaces." },
  { criterion: "Adjustability level", explanation: "Fixed cushion boards (one position) are sufficient for upright sitting. Angle-only adjustable models reduce neck strain for video watching. Height-plus-angle models (SAIJI) support sitting, semi-reclined, and fully reclined positions. Choose based on how many different postures you actually use." },
  { criterion: "Cushion base type", explanation: "Standard foam compresses fastest. Microbead fill (LapGear Designer) conforms better and lasts longer. Bolster cushions (LapGear Pro) provide structured support on the outer edges of both thighs. Thicker foam (GORILLA GRIP) provides more padding but is heavier." },
  { criterion: "Surface width vs laptop size", explanation: "A 15-inch laptop needs at least a 17-inch wide surface. A 17-inch laptop needs at least a 19-inch surface. Add 5 to 7 inches over the laptop width if you want to use an external mouse on the same surface. Check the spec width, not the displayed laptop compatibility range." },
  { criterion: "Foldable legs and storage", explanation: "Non-folding lap desks take up permanent space in a small bedroom. Foldable leg designs (SAIJI Foldable) collapse flat for under-mattress storage. If storage space is limited, a foldable design is practical enough to justify over a fixed board of similar specs." }

export const faq: { q: string; a: string }[] = [
  { q: "Is it safe to use a laptop in bed with a lap desk?", a: "Using a hard-surface lap desk in bed is safer than placing the laptop directly on bedding. Soft bedding blocks laptop bottom vents and causes overheating. A lap desk elevates the laptop off the bed surface with a hard base that keeps vents completely clear, which protects both the laptop hardware and your legs from heat." },
  { q: "What size lap desk do I need for a 15-inch laptop?", a: "A lap desk with at least a 17-inch wide surface comfortably holds a 15-inch laptop with clearance on both sides. For a 17-inch gaming laptop, choose at least a 19-inch wide surface. Add extra width if you also want to use an external mouse on the same surface." },
  { q: "Do adjustable lap desks work while lying down?", a: "Height-plus-angle adjustable models (SAIJI XL, SAIJI medium) work in multiple reclining positions including semi-reclined and near-horizontal. Fixed-height cushion boards work best for upright sitting. If you use your laptop in bed from multiple positions, an adjustable model is worth the premium." },
  { q: "How do I store a lap desk in a small bedroom?", a: "Foldable leg lap desks (SAIJI Foldable) collapse flat and store under a mattress or standing in a closet. Non-folding models like cushion boards are thinner and can often stand on end in a corner. The SAIJI XL with legs is the most space-consuming when not folded." },
  { q: "Can I use a lap desk on a sofa?", a: "Yes. Lap desks designed for bed use work equally well on sofas and armchairs. The cushioned base adapts to sofa cushion surfaces in the same way it adapts to mattress surfaces. Height-adjustable models work on sofas by adjusting to the lower typical sofa seat height." }
