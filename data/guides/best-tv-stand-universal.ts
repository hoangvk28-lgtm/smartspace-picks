export const buyingCriteria: BuyingCriterion[] = [
  {
    criterion: "VESA pattern range",
    explanation:
      "Check your TV's exact VESA hole spacing (in millimeters) against the stand's supported range. A wide advertised range like 800x600mm does not guarantee it covers every pattern inside that range, so confirm your TV's specific measurement before ordering.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Weight capacity",
    explanation:
      "Match the stand's rated capacity to your TV's actual weight with a margin, not just its screen size. Larger TVs can vary significantly in weight depending on panel technology, so check your TV's spec sheet rather than assuming size alone determines the right stand.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Height adjustability",
    explanation:
      "More height positions mean finer control over eye-level viewing height, which matters most when the stand sits on furniture of a fixed height. Stands with only 2 or 3 levels still work but offer less precision than those with 9 or more.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Swivel and tilt",
    explanation:
      "Swivel angle lets you angle the screen toward a seating area off to the side, while tilt helps reduce glare from windows or overhead lighting. If your room has fixed seating directly in front of the TV, these features matter less.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Base material and stability",
    explanation:
      "Tempered glass bases add weight low to the ground, which can improve stability, while steel-only or wood bases keep the unit lighter. For rooms with pets or children, a wider, heavier base reduces tip risk.",
  },
  {
    criterion: "Tabletop vs floor-standing",
    explanation:
      "Tabletop stands sit on existing furniture and need less floor space, while floor-standing units are freestanding and often include storage shelves or built-in power outlets. Choose based on whether you already have furniture to place the TV on.",
  },
];

export const faq: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: "What does 'universal' mean for a TV stand?",
    a: "A universal TV stand is designed to fit a range of TV sizes and VESA mounting patterns rather than one specific TV model. This makes it a flexible option if you plan to reuse the stand with a future TV, but you still need to verify your exact TV's VESA pattern and weight fall within the stand's supported range before buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I find my TV's VESA pattern?",
    a: "Check your TV's user manual or the manufacturer's spec sheet, which lists the VESA mount pattern in millimeters, such as 200x200mm or 400x400mm. You can also measure the distance between the mounting holes on the back of the TV directly if the manual is unavailable.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which universal TV stand fits the largest TVs?",
    a: "The PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand Mount (Pick 2) fits the largest TVs in this list, up to 75 inches, with a 110 lb capacity and an established review history of over 18,200 ratings.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do universal TV stands work without drilling into the TV?",
    a: "Most of these stands still require attaching mounting brackets to the back of the TV using the existing VESA screw holes, which does not involve drilling into the TV itself. Several picks advertise a no-drill setup process for attaching the stand to furniture, meaning no holes are needed in your table or media console.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best universal TV stand for a large or heavy TV?",
    a: "For TVs up to 75 inches with a proven review history, the PERLESMITH Universal TV Stand Mount (Pick 2) offers 110 lb capacity and 800x600mm VESA support, the highest capacity and widest VESA range in this list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a tabletop stand or a floor-standing TV stand?",
    a: "A tabletop stand works if you already have a media console, dresser, or table to place the TV on and just need the swivel or height mechanism. A floor-standing unit like the Greenstell (Pick 5) is freestanding and often adds storage shelves or built-in power outlets, useful if you do not already have furniture for the TV.",
